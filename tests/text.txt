Typer is a library for building CLI applications that users will love using and developers will love creating. Based on Python type hints.

It's also a command line tool to run scripts, automatically converting them to CLI applications.

The key features are:

Intuitive to write: Great editor support. Completion everywhere. Less time debugging. Designed to be easy to use and learn. Less time reading docs.
Easy to use: It's easy to use for the final users. Automatic help, and automatic completion for all shells.
Short: Minimize code duplication. Multiple features from each parameter declaration. Fewer bugs.
Start simple: The simplest example adds only 2 lines of code to your app: 1 import, 1 function call.
Grow large: Grow in complexity as much as you want, create arbitrarily complex trees of commands and groups of subcommands, with options and arguments.
Run scripts: Typer includes a typer command/program that you can use to run scripts, automatically converting them to CLIs, even if they don't use Typer internally.
